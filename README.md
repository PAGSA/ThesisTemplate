# ThesisTemplate

HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE(updated by Caleb Miller, calebmiller@uvic.ca)

Orginal document distributed by University of Victoria Library, http://libguides.uvic.ca/uvicspace/etds/latextemplate

(1) "ThesisMain.tex" is the base tex file for the project

(2) Set Masters Thesis, or PhD dissertation on line 40 of main file

(3) The generated pdf contains useful knowledge on how to do basic latex as well as thesis structure

(4) I added a lot of custom packages and commands, take a look through macros/use_packages for how to use these

(5) macros/astro is astro specific commands and shortcuts

(6) If you discover a package is inferior or redundant let me know, also if you feel something else could be added let me know
